This project is working on the challenging problem of using a Pre-trained ResNet50 model to train on the imagewoof dataset and 
visualize the heat-map by using GRADCAM for the mislabeled image.
It is following and using the open source of https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html#torchvision.models.resnet50 and https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html
